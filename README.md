# Simple-Auto-Clicker-C-
This is a very simple auto clicker created in c#

To use, compile code using which ever compiler you use. (I use DotNet)

Build tthe source code

To run make sure you have set the correct toggle key (defualt A) so that you can turn it on and off

Click Delay can also be adjusted as well.

Enjoy!
